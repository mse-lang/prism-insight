# PRISM MY DESK

Personal Korean stock analysis, paper trading and explicitly activated KIS automation, forked from PRISM-INSIGHT.

**[개인 데스크 사용 안내](README_PERSONAL_ko.md)** · Run `python -m personal.server` and open <http://127.0.0.1:8866>.

Watchlists, public quotes, daily charts, local portfolios, trade journals and CSV export work without extra Python packages. `--provider demo` selects explicitly synthetic offline data. Manual desk orders remain simulated. The separate automation page supports local paper, KIS paper and KIS live accounts, with explicit configuration and live activation. It starts stopped after every server restart. Original AI reports are optional and require separate configuration; they do not submit automation orders.

Original project documentation follows. Original license and attribution are preserved.

## NEW: Stance — Which System Trading Strategy Is Winning Right Now?

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/stance-ecosystem-en.png" alt="Stance strategy leaderboard comparing return, worst drawdown, average invested exposure, and record rate across KRX and US strategies" width="100%">
</p>

**Past results? We don't take them.** Every Stance record starts at registration — no uploaded track records, no backfills. Decisions and outcomes build one continuous public record that shows a strategy's **actual skill and risk**, not a cherry-picked highlight reel. Rankings are split into KRX and US and show return beside worst drawdown, average invested exposure, and record rate.

- **Find what is working now** — compare every strategy under one rulebook
- **Look past the headline return** — see risk, real exposure, and missing records
- **Trust the timeline** — the server seals decision time and price, then calculates what happens next
- **Enter your own strategy** — let a coding agent discover, register, connect, and test it

**[See the live leaderboard](https://analysis.stocksimulation.kr/?tab=stance)** · **[Enter my strategy](https://analysis.stocksimulation.kr/?tab=stance)** · **[Read the quickstart](stance/QUICKSTART.md)**

<details>
<summary><strong>How does my strategy join?</strong></summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/stance-integration-en.png" alt="Connect a strategy to Stance by opening its project, pasting one instruction into a coding agent, reviewing detected strategies and profiles, and approving automatic registration and integration" width="100%">
</p>

Open your strategy project in **Codex CLI, Cursor, Claude Code, or another coding agent**, then paste the instruction copied from the Stance dashboard into its chat. The agent finds separate strategies and KRX/US portfolios, asks only for missing public profile details, shows the registration plan, and proceeds only after your approval. It also stores keys, changes the code, and runs tests.

Your strategy appears under **Building a record** from its first decision. For stock markets, official ranking begins after **63 trading days and 20 closed trades that each used at least 1% of assets**. The record starts on connection day; historical results cannot be backfilled. No live brokerage account, balance, or broker key is required.

## NEW: ChatGPT Plus/Pro Subscription Support

**No API key? No problem.** PRISM-INSIGHT now supports running analysis directly through your ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) or Pro ($200/mo) subscription via the **Codex OAuth Proxy**.

```bash
# One-time login (browser will open for ChatGPT auth)
python -m cores.chatgpt_proxy.oauth_login

# Re-authenticate (switch account, or refresh expired tokens)
python -m cores.chatgpt_proxy.oauth_login --force

# Run with your ChatGPT subscription
PRISM_OPENAI_AUTH_MODE=chatgpt_oauth python stock_analysis_orchestrator.py --mode morning
```

> Tokens auto-refresh in the background, so you only need to log in again if you change ChatGPT accounts or your password.

Zero API bills. Same powerful analysis. Your existing subscription does the work.

## Trading Performance — Season 2

![PRISM-INSIGHT Season 2: realized 10-slot account return vs. KOSPI/KOSDAQ and S&P 500/Nasdaq](docs/images/season2-performance-en.png)

We show two measures of the same closed trades:

- **Sum of per-trade returns** — each closed trade's return added up. Not compounded and not weighted by position size.
- **10-slot account return** — realized profit of a simulated account split into 10 equal slots (a partial-size buy counts by its share of a slot). Closed trades only, not compounded.

| | Korea (Season 2) | US |
|---|---|---|
| Period | 2025-09-30 ~ 2026-10-02 | 2026-01-28 ~ 2026-10-02 |
| Closed trades | 211 | 127 |
| Win rate | 40.3% (85 wins) | 33.1% (42 wins) |
| Average return per trade | +1.68% | +0.65% |
| Sum of per-trade returns | +355.3% | +82.8% |
| **10-slot account return** | **+35.2%** | **+8.3%** |
| Largest drop of the account curve | −9.3%p | −13.7%p |
| Same-period index | KOSPI +103.5% (3,431 → 6,982)<br>KOSDAQ +5.3% (847 → 892) | S&P 500 +10.8% (6,969 → 7,723)<br>Nasdaq +14.8% (23,685 → 27,191) |
| Best closed trades | Samsung Electro-Mechanics +86.8%<br>SK hynix +73.8%<br>SK Square +57.6% | Micron +105.7%, Micron +52.8%<br>IBM +27.0% |

**The account trailed KOSPI in this period, and we want to be upfront about it.** KOSPI roughly doubled while KOSDAQ rose about 5%, a rally led by large-cap semiconductor stocks. PRISM's own exit review (October 2026) found the biggest gap: in Korean trades that rose 30% or more within 60 trading days of entry, the median realized gain was +2% while the median peak gain was +60%. The system was selling its leaders too early. The changes in the next section target exactly that, and we will keep publishing both measures so the effect can be checked.

## How PRISM Trades Now (Oct 2026)

![How PRISM trades now: screening, AI analysis, buy decision, small first buy, scenario adds, leader hold, re-entry, weekly review](docs/images/how-prism-trades-en.png)

**The direction.** PRISM follows O'Neil-style trend following. Most trades are kept small and cut quickly, and the account is meant to grow in steps from a few stocks that make big moves. Trading more raises the chance of finding those stocks, but repeated stop-losses can drain the account, so the core skill is **screening and buying the right stocks**.

| Step | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Screening** | Morning and afternoon triggers pick stocks with unusual price and volume momentum. Each trigger gets a quality weight (0.7–1.3) from PRISM's own last 180 days: how often its candidates reached +20%, and the average realized result. Weak triggers no longer get a guaranteed final spot. |
| **2. AI analysis** | Specialized agents write the report (technicals, trading flows, financials, industry, news, market), then an investment strategy. |
| **3. Buy decision** | The buy agent scores the setup from 1 to 10 against a written rubric: fundamentals (profitability, balance sheet, growth, business clarity), momentum signals, and a trend check. An entry also needs the minimum score for the current market regime, a risk/reward floor, and a stop-loss no wider than the regime limit (−5% to −7%). |
| **4. Small first buy** | The account is split into 10 equal slots. A new position starts at 30–80% of one slot, sized by the stock's volatility; high-scoring setups from the strongest triggers start a step larger. |
| **5. Scenario adds** | At entry, the AI writes 2–4 add scenarios (for example a breakout, or a pullback that recovers) and updates them every day. Code buys more only when a scenario's conditions are met, only above the average cost, never more than the previous buy, within the original risk budget, and up to one full slot. A confirmed strong move (8% above entry on 1.5× normal volume, after a first add that day) can add a second time in the same session. |
| **6. Leader hold** | A stock that closes 20% above its first buy price within 4–15 trading days, without being stretched far above its 50-day average, is treated as a leader. For up to 40 trading days it is sold only if it closes below the 50-day line or falls below the first buy price. Stocks that jump 20% in 1–3 days keep the normal profit-protection stops. |
| **7. Re-entry** | A stock that was stopped out, or skipped because of its price location, is watched for up to 60 trading days. If it reclaims its key level shortly before the close (KR 14:00, US 13:50), an AI re-check must approve the buy. Up to 3 attempts in each watch period, and at most 2 re-entry orders per market per day. |
| **8. Review loop** | A weekly leader report tracks big-winner capture, missed winners, stop-loss cost, and results by trigger. A two-week review (Oct 18, 2026) judges each October change against the same yardsticks. |

Most of these changes went live between Oct 2 and Oct 4, 2026, and Oct 6 is the first trading day under all of them, so the Season 2 numbers above mostly predate them. Design notes (Korean): [direction](docs/TRADING_CHANGE_REVIEW_HARNESS.md) · [trigger priority](docs/TRIGGER_QUALITY_PRIORITY_ko.md) · [small first buy](docs/micro-split/B3_LIVE_ko.md) · [scenario adds](docs/micro-split/ADD_SCENARIOS_DESIGN_ko.md) · [leader hold](docs/RUNNER_HOLD_RULE_ko.md) · [re-entry](docs/REENTRY_V3_LIVE_ko.md) · [weekly report](docs/WEEKLY_RUNNER_REPORT_ko.md) · [two-week review](docs/TWO_WEEK_REVIEW_ko.md)

## How the Trading System Learned

The Korean-market history shows two opposite failure modes: avoiding too many
entries, then taking risk without enough state control. The releases from
v1.16.7 through v2.18 progressively moved the system from prompt-level bias
correction to deterministic regime, exit-state, and re-entry safeguards.

![PRISM-INSIGHT trading evolution from observation bias to state-based risk control](docs/images/trading-evolution-en.png)

> The figures are diagnostic. Cumulative return is the sum of trade-level return
> rates, while outcomes for unentered candidates are post-hoc observations—not a
> time-weighted portfolio return or a realizable backtest.

### October 2026: what we tested, kept, and dropped

Before a rule changes, PRISM replays it on its own past candidates and trades, and the conclusion goes into a lessons ledger so the same question is not tested twice.

**Dropped** (did not beat the current rules):
- **Pocket-pivot and volume-confirmation triggers** (2018–2026): the volume condition added nothing in either market.
- **Buying when a fallen stock reclaims its 50- and 200-day lines together**: no edge, and worse in Korea.
- **A plain O'Neil 8-week hold to the 50-day line**: worse results (Korea −43%p and US about −40%p in summed trade returns), because stocks that jumped 20% in 1–3 days gave back almost all of the gain waiting for a distant 50-day line.
- **Hourly stop checks, volatility-based (ATR) stops, and executing raised stops only at the close**: all did worse than the current stops.

**Adopted**:
- **Leader hold** only for stocks that reach +20% in 4–15 trading days without being stretched above the 50-day line (Korea +57%p across 7 affected trades; a small, in-sample result that the weekly report keeps tracking).
- **Small first buys plus AI-written add scenarios** instead of a fixed +2% / +4% ladder, with faster adds for confirmed strength.
- **Up to 3 re-entry attempts** in each watch period. The old one-time limit had cut off profitable re-entries (Korea 4 of 7, US 13 of 43).
- **Trigger priority from PRISM's own record**, and a volume-surge trigger that now requires a rising price.
